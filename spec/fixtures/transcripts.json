We had essentially about two duffel bags, if you will, sized -- we had two duffel bags worth of equipment apiece approximately. A lot of the equipment that was required for our contact was procured or acquired in Baghdad.</p><p><b>What kinds of equipment did you need to acquire in Baghdad?</b></p><p>We purchased vehicles and we purchased weapons off the black market. We purchased ammunition. We purchased a significant amount of Cuban cigars and liquor, which were traded for U.S. military equipment in Baghdad and the surrounding area.</p>",

They were locally purchased in Baghdad.</p><p>A lot of high-end sedans are common in Baghdad, like BMW 740s, Mercedes 600 series and 500 series sedans. We purchased those types of vehicles and we purchased a few utilitarian trucks and stuff like that.</p><p>There was a specific automobile dealership that we dealt with when we first started purchasing vehicles over there. We got titles with each vehicle. When the whole thing was over I think we were missing titles on probably 25, 24, 25 vehicles, which I thought indicated they were stolen vehicles.</p><p><b>Do you know how Triple Canopy managed to acquire vehicles that didn't have titles?</b></p><p>It's a cash economy in Iraq. There is no electronic funds transfer. There is no -- when you're dealing with locals at this time in 2004, so we paid cash.</p><p>My initial concern, which I relayed to Mr. Nicholson, is that these vehicles are a lot more expensive than what we were purchasing for. We were getting $60-$70,000 vehicles for $25-30,000. As long as we had the title we were good with that. When the titles stopped coming in the requirement to be contract compliant and purchase the vehicles as specified by the contract superseded the need to have a title. So the vehicles were purchased anyway.</p>",

What did you mean by that?</b></p><p>Triple Canopy purchased over 900 AK-47 rifles on the black market, several machine guns, PKM machine guns. RPK long barrel AK-47s, several Dragunov sniper rifles. These weapons were purchased through connections that we had in Baghdad, local connections from --</p><p>Well, there is no legal way to purchase weapons over there. So you're either supporting organized crime or you're supporting the insurgency. Organized crime is not allowed to operate over there without paying some sort of -- without it being under the -- the insurgency knows about these activities and I believe there is a tax paid to allow them to operate.</p><p>Additionally, to weapons purchased from the insurgents or the black market, Triple Canopy received a letter from Mr. Chris Vauxhall of the Coalition Provisional Authority, which allowed Triple Canopy to acquire captured enemy weapons at U.S. Army Corps collection points.</p><p>Tony Nicholson directed Triple Canopy to acquire these weapons whenever possible, to make regular stops at these collection points, and to acquire these weapons, and bring them back.</p><p>If they were functional they were to be used by our personnel; if they were nonfunctional, his guidance was, as long as it's got a serial number, we can tell the government we purchased it and turn that in at the end of the contract when this contract is reconciled. So they were acquired for free and the intention was to use them as contractor-purchased equipment.</p>",

        "transcript": "<p><b>Did you raise any concerns with Tony Nicholson about using those collection point collected weapons as contractor-purchased equipment?</b></p><p>I did not initially, and the reason was when we first went over there it was a mad scramble to get the equipment that we needed to be operational. We went over there with no weapons, with very little equipment beyond personal gear such as body armor. So initially the big push was to get weapons so that we could protect ourselves and we could protect our customers, Department of State diplomats.</p><p>Then once that amount was exceeded -- generally youhave one weapon per man and 10 percent sparing is the standard logistic lowdown for weapons. Once that was exceeded I began to look at it a little closer, because I tracked all expenditures for Triple Canopy's operations in Iraq every penny the first year.</p>",

They are a lot more expensive because they're a lot easier to conceal. They're $600 apiece. PKR machine guns depending on the condition are $800 to $1,200 apiece. The Dragunov sniper rifles are $600.

Triple Canopy essentially took out a bunch of loans to finance their business, which is not uncommon. Those loans were repaid with U.S. government tax dollars, fee-for-service. We were providing a security service, the government paid us a fee. So essentially tax dollars were used to buy insurgent weapons.</p><p><b>Which funded the insurgency?</b></p><p>That's correct.</p><p><b>Objection. Argumentative</b></p><p>Yes, that is correct.</p>",

Would you explain what you meant, what that was about?</b><p><p>There was a very strong guidance from Tony Nicholson that U.S. soldiers were not to be paid cash for the equipment that they were giving us. And so what was arranged was a barter system, where If somebody allowed us to have this equipment -- which was surplus, which was not being --</p><p>A lot of these units were getting ready to rotate back to the states. They had more gear than they were going to carry back and there was just an unbelievable amount of war material over there. So rather than having to account for it or store it or ship it back to the states, the guys responsible for this equipment were more than happy to give it away, in exchange for that they would be provided with a bottie of liquor or a box of  Cuban cigars as a trade or a favor.</p>",

We  acquired them because they were in fact still serviceable.  We had six AT4 rockets at our headquarters.</p>  <p>We acquired over one and a half-million  dollars worth of medical supplies. We had an outstanding  medical suite. Part of our staffing was physician's  assistants and most of these people were former Special  Operations medics.</p> <p> So what we had was essentially a trauma suite,  a two-bed trauma suite with everything that a modem medical facility has to take care of guys that get shot or injured from glass damage. Heavy-duty trauma stuff.  We had medicines, we had equipment. We were outfitted better than most field units that did not have an actual  CASH unit, a medical unit.</p>",

Where we were staying in the Green Zone in a house there, a 14,700 square foot house - I had to take the measurements once for project I was working on.</p>   <p>But at any rate, one of the first priorities  for us was to secure enough water and food to withstand up  to a two-month siege. So we had a significant amount of   U.S. Army supplied food, primarily T-rations. A T-ration  is a big aluminum tray with a foil top; Three T-rations  together will feed 40 guys one meal. We had hundreds of  cases of those. </p> <p>We had dozens of pallets of bottled water. We  had - I think we already covered medical supplies. We  outfitted over 200 guys with trauma kits, bandages,  medicines, things that they need for personal first aid.  Each vehicle was supplied with a trauma kit to take care  of the customer in the event that he was injured.  </p> <p> We got a 5,000 gallon fuel truck. We got a  tractor. We got -- </p>",

        "transcript": "<p><b>All of this through trade?</b> </p> <p>That's correct. We acquired a Significant amount of equipment As a matter of fact, about I think April-May time frame we were getting a lot of flak from headquarters about the cost of our facility in-Baghdad, which is called the FOB, Forward Operating Base. There was a tot of consternation at headquarters about the cost of the, primarily the staff. Because all the people that were assigned to the FOB were overhead positions, meaning they were not assigned to a contract So that was coming right off the top of company profit. </p> <p> So what Tony ordered was a top-to-bottom inventory at everything we had at the FOB. the goal was to show how much cost Triple Canopy had avoided by acquiring all of this gear for the cost of a couple thousand dollars worth of cigars and liquor. </p> <p><b>Now, Mr. Nicholson was aware that material is coming in through trade?</b> </p> <p>He ordered it. He had guys specifically assigned to do nothing but barter, called scroungers. And they went out and they acquired equipment.</p><p> We acquired the use of land at the Baghdad International Airport and tents and PortaPotties. Essentially all of what is called life-support required to take care of our personnel. </p> <p>On a monthly basis people would rotate in country and those that were eligible to rotate out or had been fired were leaving the country. So every month there was a big transition of personnel. It was a significant logistic undertaking to do that and everything that we had to do that we acquired through Surplus military equipment. or land use or services.</p>",

A lot of items did not have an actual, what we would here in the west would consider a receipt. But there was a record of expenditures. So many items had Arabic-written invoices or receipts.</p> <p>And other examples, such as those AKs we were authorized to purchase, again, I would have to think hard about the exact number of personnel, but over people. And the government will not allow you to use invoices for more than the authorized number of weapons.</p> <p> So we acquired AKs. Probably 700 of them were paid for and 200 of them weren't. The AKs -- what I'm trying to get to is there are no serial numbers on those receipts. So AKs were turned into the government. They had not been paid for but a receipt Indicating purchase was substituted for that particular rifle.</p> <p>So the high-quality AKs stayed with Triple canopy, and the beat up, non-functional AKs acquired out of the weapons depot got transferred to the government.</p>",

He was a former Iraqi Air Force Officer who was recommended to us by another company - I believe it was Custer Battles - as a person who could arrange a supplies from the local economy. </p> <p>We bought probably the majority of our weapons other purchases,on the local economy through Jamal. He was not the exclusive provider, but I would say the vast majority.</p> <p><b>But the majority of the weapons that Triple Canopy got through the black market were Soviet make?</b> </p> <p>Yes. Although there were some Browning High Powers. There were a couple of Smith & Wesson revolvers, a couple of Walther PPKs. We were getting a wide variety of stuff at first. And then there were -- a couple of things happened.</p> <p>We put in a request, an export license and an end-user certificate for the Department of State. Unfortunately, the Department of state takes many, many months to grant these approvals. And in the meantime we had to have an operational capability, which meant we had to have weapons So we did not get authorization to purchase high-quality U.S. made weapons (where are Glocks made? Germany?) High-quality U.S. and European weapons until maybe May or June. And in the meantime our contract stipulated that we had to have a full operational capability. We started the first one 15 February, the next one 15 March, the next one 15 April. </p> <p>So we had to have full operational capability in order to be contract compliant on those dates. So we purchased the weapons required for that on the black market. The whole mind set at the time was whatever It takes to get the job done we're going to do it.</p>",

So when they are, given that designation of not serviceable, they are taken off the record books as expended, well, they weren't actually expended.</p> <p>A typical example would be a dust seal on the end of the rocket was broken. It is highly likely that dust would get in there and contaminate the rocket's guidance and launch propulsion mechanism. And so it is unsafe to use at that time by U.S. Army standards, which  are pretty high.</p> <p>So they survey the weapon, say this is no longer usable and it is taken off the books.
