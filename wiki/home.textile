  # Install the gem:
  sudo gem install vid-skim

The *Video Skimmer* builds an HTML page that allows you to surround a *YouTube* video with transcripts and annotations. The resulting HTML can be dropped into a content management system, or into the middle of an article. In order to annotate a video, you write a JSON specification that uses timecodes to mark out certain segments, and includes the accompanying text. The @vidskim@ command will use your specification to wrap the video with a clickable timeline, and a navigation bar to each of your segments. As the video plays, the accompanying text is shown alongside.

h3. Usage

First, use the @vidskim@ command to install a *specification folder*, where you'll keep the JSON files for each of your videos:

<pre>
  >> vidskim install ~/video_skimmer
  installed ~/video_skimmer/html
  installed ~/video_skimmer/videos
</pre>

Then, write your video's specification in a [[Production]] format. When you're ready to build out the HTML page:

<pre>
  >> vidskim build ~/video_skimmer
</pre>

All of the specifications inside of the @videos@ folder have been read, and their corresponding pages generated into the @html@ folder, ready for inclusion in your website.
