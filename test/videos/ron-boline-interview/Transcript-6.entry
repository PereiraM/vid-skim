["00:08:31","00:09:50"]
<p><b>Now, you also mentioned something about Cuban cigars and liquor that was purchased for trade. Would you explain what you meant, what that was about?</b><p><p>There was a very strong guidance from Tony Nicholson that U.S. soldiers were not to be paid cash for the equipment that they were giving us. And so what was arranged was a barter system, where If somebody allowed us to have this equipment -- which was surplus, which was not being --</p><p>A lot of these units were getting ready to rotate back to the states. They had more gear than they were going to carry back and there was just an unbelievable amount of war material over there. So rather than having to account for it or store it or ship it back to the states, the guys responsible for this equipment were more than happy to give it away, in exchange for that they would be provided with a bottie of liquor or a box of  Cuban cigars as a trade or a favor.</p>
