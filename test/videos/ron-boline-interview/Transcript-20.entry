["00:28:35","00:30:00"]
<p><b>Did you have discussions with Tony Nicholson about that?</b></p> <p>Well, we did a couple of times. And again, his direction was, we're going to get what we need to get to make this operation successful. His words are, "We're going to set ourselves up for success" and that was a constant theme. We're going to set ourselves up for success.</p> <p><b>What did you say when he said that to you?</b> </p><p>Well, It was a constant saying. So I don't have specific - I mean, can I get the question more defined?</p> <p><b>How did you react when he explained that the reason for this bartering was to set yourself up for success?</b> </p><p>The intent was to get what we needed to do the job. The whole thing was mission focused - let's get this done.</p> <p>Me personally, I had a lot of stuff to do, running all the different facets of the business end. So I was not particularly concerned with what they were doing to acquire this stuff. I noted it and said, wow, that is pretty impressive. And you know, advised Tony that some aspects of that were pretty questionable. And he essentially - excuse my language - said "**** it. We're going to do this. We're going to set ourselves up for success."</p>
