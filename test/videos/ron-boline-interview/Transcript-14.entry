Tracking the Weapons
["00:20:17","00:22:13"]
<p><b>Well first of all, who ends up buying the weapons back from Triple Canopy?</b></p> <p>They are not bought back from Triple Canopy They are turned over to the government because they are government items. The company, Triple Canopy, purchased them on behalf of the government.</p> <p><b>I understand. So effectively what happens is Triple Canopy purchases the items, not to possess it but simply to use it during the course of its work in Iraq and then the idea is it will turn it back into the government at the conclusion because it's the government's weapon? </b></p><p> That's correct. </p> <p><b>And in some cases AKs that were purchased on the black market were turned back over to the government as contractor purchased weapons?</b> </p> <p>Yes. </p> <p> <b>And those had actually been purchased?</b></p> <p> Yes.</p> <p><b>And'the same with all the weapons you got from Colt? </b></p><p>Yes.</p> <p><b>So the only category of weapons we're talking about that got turned back over to the government, that were not actually purchased by Triple Canopy, were some of the ones you got from the collection points? </b> </p><p>Yes. </p> <p><b>And the ones you turned back over to the government that Triple Canopy had not paid for, were those primarily non-functioning ones? </b></p><p> Some were functional and some were not. Again, the key point being a serial number. That's how weapons are tracked, a serial number that is etched into the receiver. The main component of a firearm. </p>
