["00:16:35","00:18:46"]
<p><b>What was the source of those weapons, sir, the systems of acquisition that we've been discussing?</b></p> <p>Of the AT4 rockets?</p> <p><b>RPGs.</b></p> <p>Oh, RPGs we bought on the black market. </p><p><b>And the AT4s were ones you had gotten from the Army as non-serviceable?</b></p> <p>That's correct </p><p><b>So if I understand you correctly, there are basically four sources; the black market collection points, unserviceable ones from soldiers, and purchases  through the State Department using the export license and end-user certificate?</b></p> <p>Well, it's not through the State Department, it's just an authorization. The actual contract is between the company which has the authorization and the manufacturer here in the States. In our case that was Colt Manufacturing for M4s and Glock for our 9mm pistols. And we also had some Armorlite AR10s for precision fire, essentially sniper weapons.</p> <p> <b>But the purchases that you made through the State Department export licenses and the end-use certificate from Colt those are legitimate purchases?</b></p> <p>Say that again. please.</p><p><b>The purchases that you made through the export license-and the end-use certificate, from Colt are all lawful purchases?</b></p> <p>Yes.<p>  <p><b>Was there anything illegal about the acquisition of weapons deemed unserviceable by the U.S Army?</b></p>  <p>Well, I believe it is illegal to hold U.S Army Department of Defense weapons. I mean, unless you're contract specifically states, that you are authorized to be issued US. military weapons it is highly illegal for a civilian to own a government weapon or to have possession of one.</p>
