["00:24:56","00:26:25"]
<p><b>Are you aware of any vehicles that were acquired through trade that was turned into the government as contractor-purchased equipment?</b> </p><p>Absolutely. Yes.</p> <p><b>How many?</b></p> <p>I believe there were 56 soft vehicles, nonarmored vehicles. I believe there were 36 hard vehldes, or armored vehicles, and they were all purchased on behalf of the government. </p><p><b>They were all purchased on behalf of the government?</b></p> <p>Yes.</p> <p><b>So Triple canopy actually bought these items?</b> </p>That's correct. <p><b>And then turned them back. into the government?</b> </p> <p>Yes. </p><p><b>I must not have been clear on my question What I'm concerned with is any vehicles that Triple Canopy did not purchase that it attempted to turn back into the government as contractor-purchased equipment.</b></p> <p>No. All the vehicles we purchased there was a receipt for them. In country we purchased the soft vehicles locally. The guys at corporate purchased the hard cars, or armored vehicles. And they were flown in country or driven in from Ahmad. And so there was to my knowledge, all of those vehicles were paid for and they were definitely considered government property. </p>
