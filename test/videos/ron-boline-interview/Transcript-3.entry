["00:05:45","00:06:53"]
<p><b>Did you raise any concerns with Tony Nicholson about using those collection point collected weapons as contractor-purchased equipment?</b></p><p>I did not initially, and the reason was when we first went over there it was a mad scramble to get the equipment that we needed to be operational. We went over there with no weapons, with very little equipment beyond personal gear such as body armor. So initially the big push was to get weapons so that we could protect ourselves and we could protect our customers, Department of State diplomats.</p><p>Then once that amount was exceeded -- generally youhave one weapon per man and 10 percent sparing is the standard logistic lowdown for weapons. Once that was exceeded I began to look at it a little closer, because I tracked all expenditures for Triple Canopy's operations in Iraq every penny the first year.</p>
