<p>As violence soared in 2003, U.S. officials in Iraq demanded that private security firms begin operations within days of winning a contract. And yet back home, federal agencies including the State Dept. refused to provide weapons export licenses to many firms, including Triple Canopy. Triple Canopy acknowledges that it bought weapons from dealers in Iraq, but says that it took precautions to make sure that money did not flow into the hands of insurgents, such as using Iraqi buyers approved by the U.S. military.</p>
