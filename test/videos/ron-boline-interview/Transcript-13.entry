Lack of Oversight
["00:18:46","00:20:17"]
<p><b>Did the U.S. government know about the black market AKs that Triple Canopy possessed?</b> </p> <p>I don't think so. At this time you have to put things in context. There was virtually zero oversight on any of these security companies In Iraq at that time. There were no questions asked about -- nobody ever said where Is your export license and end-user certificate; and compared to the date that those documents were received and the date when they had weapons that were supposed to be operationally capable. And there was pretty much a blind eye turned to all of that. </p> <p><b>Do you know whether the State of Defense, or any other U.S. entity ever took an inventory of Triple Canopy's weapons?</b> </p> <p>No. In fact, the government was not concerned with the inventory a company has. The primary concern the government has is are we getting the service we're paying for. In this particular case they really don't care that happens. They just want the service.</p>
