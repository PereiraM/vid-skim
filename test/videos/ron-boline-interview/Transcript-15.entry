["00:22:13","00:24:24"]
 <p><b>I hope you understand how this would happen then. If Triple Canopy had acquired the firearm at one of the collection points, and then turned it back over to the government wouldn't the government have a that that particular serial number had not been purchased?</b></p> <p> No. Because when these weapons were collected from the collection points, when they were acquired from the collection points they did not go out by serial number. They just said, yeah, take them. There was no paperwork associated with that. </p> <p>We typically would show up on the letter of authorization saying, hey look, we can have them, give them to us and depending on the mood. of the particular guard there, you could either get them or they could tell you no. So it was pretty haphazard. </p> <p><b>And did you previously testify that with regard to the weapons received from the collection points, you got about 200 AKs and some cats and dogs?</b> </p> <p>Yes </p> <p><b>Of those weapons, of those 200, how many were turned back into the government as contractor-purchase weapons?</b> </p> <p>I do not know. </p> <p><b>Do you have an estimate?</b> </p> <p>I would estimate, since they were essentially unserviceable or in poor condition probably everyone they could. </p> <p><b>By everyone they could, is that all 200 or some percentage less than that? I would bet you money it was all of them, however, I do not have direct knowledge of that. </b> </p><p><b>When you say you don't have direct knowledge, you don't have the direct knowledge of whether these weapons were serviceable? </b></p> <p>No. I don't know if they were serviceable and I don't know if they were actually depicted as a contractor-purchased equipment. They were acquired with the Intent to do that and that was specific direction by Tony Nicholson.</p>
