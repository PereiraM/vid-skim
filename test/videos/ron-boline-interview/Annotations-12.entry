Turning the Equipment Back In
["00:26:25","00:27:17"]
<p>Boline testified that in accounting for weapons with contracting officials, Triple Canopy attempted to substitute weapons obtained for free from the caches with weapons purchased by the government. In this way, Triple Canopy would be able to retain the high-quality government-financed weapons while giving the government the lower quality weapons it had obtained for free. Boline acknowledges that he was not present when the contract ended to see whether such a swap actually occurred. Triple Canopy denies such an exchange happened.</p>
