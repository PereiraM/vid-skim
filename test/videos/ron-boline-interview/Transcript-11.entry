Unusable Rockets

<p><b>So I understand the sources of Triple Canopy's  armaments -- and I'm specifically only am talking about weapons here -- some were purchased from the blackmarket some were gotten through collection points of captured weapons manned by the Army, and Triple Canopy also had an  export license and end user certificate from the Department of State, Whereby it could acquire U.S. and  European weapons.</b> </p> <p>That's correct.</p> <p><b>Were there other sources of weapons that Triple canopy had in Iraq?</b></p> <p>They got a few U.S. Army weapons that were specifically those AT4 rockets that were considered, not serviceable anymore by the Army. So when they are, given that designation of not serviceable, they are taken off the record books as expended, well, they weren't actually expended.</p> <p>A typical example would be a dust seal on the end of the rocket was broken. It is highly likely that dust would get in there and contaminate the rocket's guidance and launch propulsion mechanism. And so it is unsafe to use at that time by U.S. Army standards, which  are pretty high.</p> <p>So they survey the weapon, say this is no longer usable and it is taken off the books. It still works and we took them. We had them. You know; in addition to the AKs we had a  significant number of RPGs also, which I had not mentioned yet.</p>
