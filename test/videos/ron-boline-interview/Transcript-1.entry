<p><b>You mentioned that vehicles were purchased actually in Baghdad?</b></p><p>Under the terms of our call order, Triple Canopy acquired as contractor-purchased equipment on behalf of the U.S. government 56 what we call "soft" vehicles, which are non-armored vehicles. They were locally purchased in Baghdad.</p><p>A lot of high-end sedans are common in Baghdad, like BMW 740s, Mercedes 600 series and 500 series sedans. We purchased those types of vehicles and we purchased a few utilitarian trucks and stuff like that.</p><p>There was a specific automobile dealership that we dealt with when we first started purchasing vehicles over there. We got titles with each vehicle. When the whole thing was over I think we were missing titles on probably 25, 24, 25 vehicles, which I thought indicated they were stolen vehicles.</p><p><b>Do you know how Triple Canopy managed to acquire vehicles that didn't have titles?</b></p><p>It's a cash economy in Iraq. There is no electronic funds transfer. There is no -- when you're dealing with locals at this time in 2004, so we paid cash.</p><p>My initial concern, which I relayed to Mr. Nicholson, is that these vehicles are a lot more expensive than what we were purchasing for. We were getting $60-$70,000 vehicles for $25-30,000. As long as we had the title we were good with that. When the titles stopped coming in the requirement to be contract compliant and purchase the vehicles as specified by the contract superseded the need to have a title. So the vehicles were purchased anyway.</p>
