<p><b>What kinds of equipment did Triple canopy  obtain through this barter system?</b></p> <p>Essentially everything, including AT4 rockets, which were deemed unusable by the U.S. military. We  acquired them because they were in fact still serviceable.  We had six AT4 rockets at our headquarters.</p>  <p>We acquired over one and a half-million  dollars worth of medical supplies. We had an outstanding  medical suite. Part of our staffing was physician's  assistants and most of these people were former Special  Operations medics.</p> <p> So what we had was essentially a trauma suite,  a two-bed trauma suite with everything that a modem medical facility has to take care of guys that get shot or injured from glass damage. Heavy-duty trauma stuff.  We had medicines, we had equipment. We were outfitted better than most field units that did not have an actual  CASH unit, a medical unit.</p>
