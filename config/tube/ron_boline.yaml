  <p>Ronald Boline was a program manager for Triple Canopy, the Virginia-based private security company which earlier this year replaced the controversial firm Blackwater, now known as Xe, on a contract to protect State Department diplomats in Iraq. Boline, who no longer works for Triple Canopy, provided this sworn deposition in 2007 in the circuit court of Fairfax County, Virginia as part of a lawsuit for wrongful termination filed by other Triple Canopy employees. Triple Canopy said that it investigated Boline's charges, and found nothing to support them. The Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction recommended charges filed in the case earlier this year, but the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York declined to prosecute in April.</p>
