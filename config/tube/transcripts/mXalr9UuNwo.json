They were locally purchased in Baghdad.</p><p>A lot of high-end sedans are common in Baghdad, like BMW 740s, Mercedes 600 series and 500 series sedans. We purchased those types of vehicles and we purchased a few utilitarian trucks and stuff like that.</p><p>There was a specific automobile dealership that we dealt with when we first started purchasing vehicles over there. We got titles with each vehicle. When the whole thing was over I think we were missing titles on probably 25, 24, 25 vehicles, which I thought indicated they were stolen vehicles.</p><p><b>Do you know how Triple Canopy managed to acquire vehicles that didn't have titles?</b></p><p>It's a cash economy in Iraq. There is no electronic funds transfer. There is no -- when you're dealing with locals at this time in 2004, so we paid cash.</p><p>My initial concern, which I relayed to Mr. Nicholson, is that these vehicles are a lot more expensive than what we were purchasing for. We were getting $60-$70,000 vehicles for $25-30,000. As long as we had the title we were good with that. When the titles stopped coming in the requirement to be contract compliant and purchase the vehicles as specified by the contract superseded the need to have a title. So the vehicles were purchased anyway.</p>",

These weapons were purchased through connections that we had in Baghdad, local connections from --</p><p>Well, there is no legal way to purchase weapons over there. So you're either supporting organized crime or you're supporting the insurgency. Organized crime is not allowed to operate over there without paying some sort of -- without it being under the -- the insurgency knows about these activities and I believe there is a tax paid to allow them to operate.</p><p>Additionally, to weapons purchased from the insurgents or the black market, Triple Canopy received a letter from Mr. Chris Vauxhall of the Coalition Provisional Authority, which allowed Triple Canopy to acquire captured enemy weapons at U.S. Army Corps collection points.</p><p>Tony Nicholson directed Triple Canopy to acquire these weapons whenever possible, to make regular stops at these collection points, and to acquire these weapons, and bring them back.</p><p>If they were functional they were to be used by our personnel; if they were nonfunctional, his guidance was, as long as it's got a serial number, we can tell the government we purchased it and turn that in at the end of the contract when this contract is reconciled. So they were acquired for free and the intention was to use them as contractor-purchased equipment.</p>",

We went over there with no weapons, with very little equipment beyond personal gear such as body armor. So initially the big push was to get weapons so that we could protect ourselves and we could protect our customers, Department of State diplomats.</p><p>Then once that amount was exceeded -- generally youhave one weapon per man and 10 percent sparing is the standard logistic lowdown for weapons. Once that was exceeded I began to look at it a little closer, because I tracked all expenditures for Triple Canopy's operations in Iraq every penny the first year.</p>",

They are a lot more expensive because they're a lot easier to conceal. They're $600 apiece. PKR machine guns depending on the condition are $800 to $1,200 apiece. The Dragunov sniper rifles are $600.

Triple Canopy essentially took out a bunch of loans to finance their business, which is not uncommon. Those loans were repaid with U.S. government tax dollars, fee-for-service. We were providing a security service, the government paid us a fee.

And so what was arranged was a barter system, where If somebody allowed us to have this equipment -- which was surplus, which was not being --</p><p>A lot of these units were getting ready to rotate back to the states. They had more gear than they were going to carry back and there was just an unbelievable amount of war material over there. So rather than having to account for it or store it or ship it back to the states, the guys responsible for this equipment were more than happy to give it away, in exchange for that they would be provided with a bottie of liquor or a box of  Cuban cigars as a trade or a favor.</p>",

Germany?) High-quality U.S. and European weapons until maybe May or June. And in the meantime our contract stipulated that we had to have a full operational capability.

So when they are, given that designation of not serviceable, they are taken off the record books as expended, well, they weren't actually expended.</p> <p>A typical example would be a dust seal on the end of the rocket was broken. It is highly likely that dust would get in there and contaminate the rocket's guidance and launch propulsion mechanism. And so it is unsafe to use at that time by U.S. Army standards, which  are pretty high.</p> <p>So they survey the weapon, say this is no longer usable and it is taken off the books.

The actual contract is between the company which has the authorization and the manufacturer here in the States. In our case that was Colt Manufacturing for M4s and Glock for our 9mm pistols.

There were no questions asked about -- nobody ever said where Is your export license and end-user certificate; and compared to the date that those documents were received and the date when they had weapons that were supposed to be operationally capable.
